Prerequisites
-------------
- Python:
    - >= 3.5
    - Pillow

Installation
============

-----------
Windows EXE
-----------
Windows users have the option of downloading an EXE version of the script, which can be found `over here`_. If you wish to run the EXE in the terminal often, you can edit your `PATH`_ environment variable so you don't need to navigate to the program first.

.. _PATH: https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/

---------
Using pip
---------
donjon-painter is `available on PyPI`_. Until I get to creating packages for different Linux distributions, this is the ideal way of using it on them. Get it using this command:

::

    pip install --user --upgrade donjon-painter

.. _available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/donjon-painter/

--------
setup.py
--------
All that needs to be done here is to `clone this repository`_. Having done so, extract the files, and navigate to the location of said folder. Once you're done with that, run this command:

::

    python3 setup.py install

.. _clone this repository: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

Usage
=====
-------------------------
1. Download your TSV file
-------------------------
First of all, begin by heading to `donjon's Random Dungeon Generator`_ to generate the dungeon of your liking. Having done that, you should select the option to download a TSV map of the generated file, as depicted below:

.. image:: /res/donjon.png
.. _donjon's Random Dungeon Generator: https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/dungeon/

------------------
2. Run the command
------------------
Having done this, run donjon-painter. By default, if you don't specify anything, it will default to interactive mode. This brings up a menu of options in the terminal, which you can then input.

::

    donjon-painter

If you're using the EXE file, all you need to do is open it up, and this will bring you to interactive mode.

A more advanced usage entails specifying both the command and the map file of your choice:

::

    donjon-painter [OPTIONS] MAPFILE
